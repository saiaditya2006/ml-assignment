Task 4 â€“ Fitting Non-Linear Scatter Plot

Method 1: utilized linear regression to fit the non-linear data.

Method 2: We divided the dataset into 3 sub-datasets. Applied linear regression for each one, and got the predictions. We concatenated all the predictions and compared it with the actual predictions.

Method 3: We used polynomial regression with degree 1 to 20
