Interpretation of the probability:
Probability is 0.60 and 0.65 respectively for multinomial and Bernoulli based Naïve Bayes – means that model is 65% confident that sample belongs to class “-”. 
Why do we think Naïve Bayes gave only this much probability? – 
Naïve bayes assumes that all features are independent – hence “naive”. 
Also, there is class imbalance. 
What can we interpret from the probability?: the model classified all samples correctly but wasn’t very confident.
