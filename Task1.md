# ml-assignment

Scenario: 
During your work experience at SMART consultancy, your company has nominated a group of students to complete the following task for the successful completion of promotional applications. Now the company must decide the increment pattern for its employees Fail (0-5 %), Pass (6-7 %), Merit (7-8%) and Distinction (9-10%). 
The goal of this project is to use a structured solution process to build and test a system that will compete in competition. The theme of this competition is to obtain funding “Call for funds”. You and your team must rescue all members from the destructive fireplace and return them to their home before they get lost during the big move for increment! In this competition, your team must perform.

*Task 1 – ML Hard Problems, ML Use Cases, ML Good Problems*

The below challenges with Machine Learning Model design and development makes the use case to be a “Hard problem” to address:

Inadequate Training Data and the Quality of Data injected into the ML Model[2,4]
Bias and Fairness in Data [2]
Overfitting Vs Underfitting[4]
Lack of Model Interpretability and [3]
Complexity of the selected machine learning algorithm [1]
