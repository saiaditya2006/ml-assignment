*Task 1 – ML Hard Problems, ML Use Cases, ML Good Problems*

The below challenges with Machine Learning Model design and development makes the use case to be a “Hard problem” to address:

Inadequate Training Data and the Quality of Data injected into the ML Model[2,4]
Bias and Fairness in Data [2]
Overfitting Vs Underfitting[4]
Lack of Model Interpretability and [3]
Complexity of the selected machine learning algorithm [1]
